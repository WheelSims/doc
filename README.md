# WheelSims documentation

The WheelSims structuring project is an initiative funded by the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies (FRQNT) via a Team Grant (2020-2023) and et via the [FRQNT-INTER](https://regroupementinter.com) strategic group. This project aims to adopt a user-centric approach to unify the development of a shared wheelchair simulator software infrastructure, which will facilitate the technology transfer between research laboratories and from research to clinics. It is currently composed of six researchers from five universities:

## Project leader

**Félix Chénier**, Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation of Greater Montreal (CRIR), Montreal

## Researchers

**Rachid Aissaoui**, École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS), CHUM Research Centre, Montreal

**Philippe Archambault**, McGill University, Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation of Greater Montreal (CRIR), Montreal

**Dany Gagnon**, Montreal University, Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation of Greater Montreal (CRIR), Montreal

**David Labbé**, École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS), CHUM Research Centre, Montreal

**François Routhier**, Laval University, Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation and Social Integration (CIRRIS), Quebec

## PhD Students

**Ateayeh Bayat** works on the integration of haptics and virtual reality, and uses this project to build the new high-realism wheelchair simulator at the [Institut universitaire sur la réadaptation en déficience physique de Montréal (IURDPM).](https://ciusss-centresudmtl.gouv.qc.ca/mission-universitaire/designations-universitaires/institut-universitaire-sur-la-readaptation-en-deficience-physique-de-montreal/)

## Master Students

**Gabriel Després** designs and tests biofeedback modalities in para-athletes using virtual reality, in order to improve their performance.

**Clément Ghazouani** developed real-time load calculations during wheelchair propulsion on a simulator, to reduce the biomechanical and physiological load of propulsion using biofeedback.

**Ary Pizarro-Chong** developed a control loop for wheelchair simulators that does not require instrumented wheels, so that the users can use their own wheelchair without having to change anything.

## Research interns

**Abir Brahmi** developed modular virtual reality environments using Unity for wheelchair propulsion training on a simulator.

**Léa Kohl** developed a control path for the D-Box incline platform.
